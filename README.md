# MouseMusic
A simple drum machine built with HTML/CSS and Javascript. You can use your mouse to make music! 

Made following YouTube tutorial by Dev Ed.

In this project I learned: 
  a. How to create a new element using Javascript using .createElement.
  b. How to detele elements after effect to prevent app crash using .removeChild();
